The PPT Generator app takes a block of long-form text or Markdown and intelligently converts it into a structured presentation. When the user submits text, the backend routes it through a selected Large Language Model (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini) with strict JSON formatting instructions. The model parses the text into a reasonable number of slides (typically 5–20, depending on length and tone guidance). Each slide is assigned a concise title, 3–6 bullet points, and speaker notes. The outline is returned to the frontend for preview and optional editing, ensuring that slide content is human-readable, properly segmented, and contextually consistent with the use-case (e.g., investor pitch, research summary, executive brief).

The generated slide deck is not just plain text on blank slides. Instead, the app applies the visual style and assets from the uploaded PowerPoint template. The backend inspects the .pptx/.potx file to extract layouts, color themes, and font specifications defined in the template. When creating slides, it maps each outline entry to the closest matching layout (e.g., Title and Content, Section Header). If the template contains images or picture placeholders, the system attempts to reuse these assets to give the output a native, brand-consistent look. Because the final .pptx inherits PowerPoint’s theme properties, the deck matches the original template’s design elements—colors, fonts, and spacing—without requiring any custom styling logic. This approach guarantees template fidelity: the generated presentation looks as if it was authored manually inside the original design file.
